<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I started my career in business, more specifically retail and specialised Insurance and Banking.  I was one of the youngest persons to be promoted to a lending manager and then on to a portfolio manager for Suncorp Bank.</p>

<p>I transferred into IT as a business and systems analyst in 2012 after the global financial crisis and working in corporate reporting.</p>

<p>I have worked both as an analyst and as a delivery lead, I have cross-skilled myself into a full stack web development engineer and am proud to have made this journey.</p>
